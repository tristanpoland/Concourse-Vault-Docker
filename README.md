# Concourse-Vault-Docker
A simple, hastle-free template for deploying a Concourse Web UI, Concourse Worker, and Vault in Docker

# Before we start
- Make sure you have docker installed and running and that you have permissions to it (By adding yourself to the `docker` group)

# Deploying to Docker
- run `setup.sh` (No, really, it's that easy!)

# How it works
(To be added with the templates directory)
